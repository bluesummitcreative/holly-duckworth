				<p style="text-align: center;">There are good days and there are bad days. And then, there is everyday. Our 24-hour day/7-day week/365-day year can be stress inducing and anxiety creating. Most of us are overwhelmed just getting through our days. This book teaches applied mindfulness off a yoga mat or meditation pillow.</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;">Applied mindfulness consists of short two to five minute practices you can do within your "real life" to stay present in both good, and not so good, experiences in order to become your best self. Each day, you will set an intention and be inspired by quotes from historical and current public figures to assist you in mindful practices and wisdom. Whether you read once each day, or pick up this book from time to time, the experience will leave you calm and inspired.</p>
